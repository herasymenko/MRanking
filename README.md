# MRanking

A ranking app that turns playlists and collections into private tournaments, tier lists and other comparison modes.

## Start

From PowerShell in this folder:

```powershell
.\start-local.ps1
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). The first launch can take a few seconds while the local database starts.

The seeded administrator is `VodemRey`; use the password agreed for this prototype. Passwords are stored as PBKDF2 hashes, never as plain text.

## Current flow

1. Sign in with an account created by the administrator.
2. Open **Packs** and choose YouTube or YouTube Music.
3. Paste a public/unlisted playlist link, or a public profile link and choose one of its playlists.
4. Review the imported videos, edit the pack name or cover, and select the items that should stay.
5. Save a private pack and start **King of the Hill**.

At least 16 playable videos are required. Duplicate, private, deleted and unavailable entries are skipped and reported. Imported packs, in-progress games and final results persist in local SQLite storage.

The admin screen creates users, resets passwords, soft-deletes accounts without deleting their packs, and lists all private packs. Tier List, Blind Ranking and the other rating formats are visual placeholders for later development.
